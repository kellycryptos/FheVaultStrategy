# Vercel Deployment Quick Fix

## The Problem
Your Dapp at https://fhe-vault-strategybeta.vercel.app/ is showing code instead of the application.

## The Solution
The repository now has the correct configuration. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Push Updated Configuration to GitHub

```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd fhe-vault-strategybeta

# Add the new configuration files
git add vercel.json DEPLOYMENT.md VERCEL_QUICKSTART.md .gitignore .env.example

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment configuration"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel

**Option A: Automatic Redeploy**
- Vercel will automatically detect the push to your GitHub repository
- It will trigger a new deployment using the updated `vercel.json` configuration
- Wait 1-2 minutes for the build to complete

**Option B: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `fhe-vault-strategybeta` project
3. Click on it
4. Click "Deployments" tab
5. Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
6. Click "Redeploy"
7. Confirm "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

While redeploying, verify your environment variables:

1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Ensure you have:
   - **Name**: `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
   - **Value**: `0x9cD17DAD80CE2fE9b1d3804cf53e66f8930040F5`
   - **Environment**: Production (checked)

### Step 4: Test Your Dapp

After deployment completes:

1. Visit https://fhe-vault-strategybeta.vercel.app/
2. You should see the FHEVault application
3. Click "Connect Wallet" to test MetaMask integration
4. Switch to Sepolia testnet if prompted
5. Try submitting a test strategy

## What Changed?

The `vercel.json` file now tells Vercel:
- Build only the frontend: `npx vite build`
- Output to correct directory: `dist/public`
- Handle SPA routing properly

## Expected Result

After redeployment, your site should display:
- ✅ Professional FHEVault interface
- ✅ "Connect Wallet" button in header
- ✅ Strategy submission form
- ✅ Encryption status panel
- ✅ Full Dapp functionality

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see code:
1. Hard refresh the page: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors

### If build fails:
1. Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. Verify the `vercel.json` file exists in the repository root
3. Review build logs in Vercel dashboard

## Need Help?

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs in the dashboard
2. Ensure all files were committed and pushed to GitHub
3. Verify the repository structure matches the expected layout
